# VAD Tuning Guide:
# 
# If KenzAI responds to background noise:
#   - Increase vad_aggressiveness to 3
#   - Increase min_speech_duration to 0.5
#
# If KenzAI cuts you off mid-sentence:
#   - Increase silence_duration to 1.2 or 1.5
#   - Decrease vad_aggressiveness to 1
#
# If KenzAI is slow to respond:
#   - Decrease silence_duration to 0.7
#   - Keep vad_aggressiveness at 2

# Vosk Model Setup (100% OFFLINE):
# 1. Download model from: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
# 2. Recommended: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 (40MB) or vosk-model-en-us-0.22 (1.8GB)
# 3. Extract to: ./models/vosk/
# 4. Structure: ./models/vosk/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/
