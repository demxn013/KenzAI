    # ULTRA-STRICT VAD SETTINGS - Nuclear option for false triggers

# VAD Troubleshooting Guide:
#
# PROBLEM: Responds to background noise / false "the" triggers
# SOLUTION: 
#   - Set vad_aggressiveness = 3 (DONE)
#   - Set min_speech_duration = 1.0 or higher (DONE)
#   - Move away from fans, AC, computer noise
#   - Use push-to-talk mode instead (see below)
#
# PROBLEM: Cuts you off mid-sentence
# SOLUTION:
#   - Increase silence_duration to 2.0 or 2.5
#   - Speak without long pauses
#
# PROBLEM: Slow to respond
# SOLUTION:
#   - Decrease silence_duration to 1.0
#   - This is the tradeoff for accuracy
#
# PROBLEM: Still getting false triggers even at max settings
# SOLUTION: Your environment is too noisy. Options:
#   1. Use a directional microphone (cardioid pattern)
#   2. Enable push-to-talk mode (hold key to talk)
#   3. Use a quieter room
#   4. Increase min_speech_duration to 2.0

# Alternative: Push-to-Talk Mode (No VAD false triggers)
# Uncomment to enable:
# 
# interfaces:
#   voice:
#     mode: "push_to_talk"  # Hold a key to talk, release to process
#     push_key: "ctrl+space"  # Key combination to hold while talking
#     vad_aggressiveness: 2  # Can be lower since manual activation
#     silence_duration: 0.8  # Faster response with manual control
#     min_speech_duration: 0.3  # Can be lower with manual control

# Vosk Model Setup (100% OFFLINE):
# 1. Download model from: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
# 2. Recommended: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 (40MB) or vosk-model-en-us-0.22 (1.8GB)
# 3. Extract to: ./models/vosk/
# 4. Structure: ./models/vosk/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15/
